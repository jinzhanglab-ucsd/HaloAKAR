# HaloAKAR
This repository contains code used to process data generated during the HaloAKAR project. The code provided here can be used to 
1) Analyse the brightenss of cells from individual images (ImageJ Macro (ROI-selection-Macro_FarRed-Green-image.ijm) and R script for further processing of data (Brightenss_measurements.R))
2) Analysis of time course data to filter information at differen time poitns (R script (Intensities at different timepoints.R))
3) Matlab code was used to identify and pair clathrin coated pits in STED images.
4) Analyse Sort-seq results (Bash scripts for left (HAKAR_code_L_R1.sh) and right linker (HAKAR_code_R_R1.sh) and corresponding DNA to amino acid conversion file (DNA2Amino) along with the R script used for calcualtion of enrichement and filtering (Sort_Seq_Analysis.R))
The results are published in: M.S. Frei et al. bioRxiv 2024 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.10.579766v1). Please cite the preprint when using this code.
